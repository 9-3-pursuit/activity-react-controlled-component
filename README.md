# Controlled Components

This is a short practice activity to develop more experience with the controlled component pattern in React.

## Instructions

1. Choose one driver to type and share their screen.
   - Personal recommendation: choose the less confident react developer to drive. I find both partners get more out of the exercise this way.
1. Fork and clone this repo, and then install dependencies with `npm install`
1. Start up the app with `npm start` and investigate the source code a little bit. With your partner, discuss the following:
   - What is the purpose of this application?
   - What is the purpose of the form?
   - Diagram the component tree of this app
   - Why can't you type into the text inputs in the form?
1. Complete the `handleTextChange` function in the `QueueSignupForm` component
   - How will you and your partner test to see if `handleTextChange` is working?
1. Complete the `handleSubmit` function in the `QueueSignupForm` component
   - How will you and your partner test to see if `handleSubmit` is working?
